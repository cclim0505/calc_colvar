#README

Program to calculate collective variables
Coordination Number, CN
Radius of Gyration, Rg

Works for a series of structures, but for the same number of atoms ONLY.

#NOTES
Variable to hold coordinates are based on  x(j2-2), x(j2-1), x(j2)
i.e. coordinate vectors are one-dimensional.


#PARAMETERS
Parameters for Coordination Number, CN is found in the beginning statements of file 'metacncv.f'.

No parameter is required for Radius of gyration, Rg.
